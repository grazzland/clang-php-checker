Yay! You want to contribute. Fantastic! \o/

Please send a pull request against master. Code should be formatted according
to LLVM coding style (run clang-format on your changes)

Before merging I will contact you to confirm that you agree to relicense from 
University of Illinois Open Source License to PHP License in case I move the
