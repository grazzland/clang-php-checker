This "extension" serves as a testing bed for the clang static analyzer plugin.
While it is supposed to compile like a regular PHP extension it is not
functional. It (purposly) won't load into PHP.

Use PHP Clang Analyzer like this on this code:

 $ phpize
 $ scan-build ./configure
 $ scan-build -load-plugin ../libclangPHPChecker.so \
              -enable-checker php.ZPPChecker \
	      make
