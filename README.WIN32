The way it currently works is putting this folder under llvm/tools/clang/tools.
The file llvm/tools/clang/tools/CMakeList.txt has to be patched to add 
the checker subdir to the build. After that, regenerate the VS projects with
cmake and you'll see the clangPHPChecker project which can be then compiled
among others.
